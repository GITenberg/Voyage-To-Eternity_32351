description: American-born Stephen Marlowe was a prolific writer who made his mark
  in several genres, including science fiction. In the gripping page-turner Voyage
  to Eternity, the galaxy is engaged in a seemingly endless war of epic proportions.
  When young Christopher Temple is called to serve, he finds himself torn between
  a sense of duty and a desperate desire to remain with his beloved Stephanie. Will
  patriotism or romance win out?
